# HomeAutomationSystem

In this repository, we showcase the CHESSIoT tool's capability for engineering a "Home automation system" use-case. We demonstrated the tool's capability for performing system-level modeling and safety analysis using the Fault-Tree analysis approach. We will cover software development, with a focus on functional as well as behavior modeling and code generation. Finally, the system deployment plan modeling and runtime service provisioning are performed.
